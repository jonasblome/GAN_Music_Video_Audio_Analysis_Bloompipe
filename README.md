This is a copy of the synthesis module of our Bloompipe web application. The webapp can currently be found at bloompipe.de!

This module analyzes a provided audio file. The audio file is split into its harmonic and percussive content, 
which are then represented in two different float value arrays. There is also the possibility to gate the audio
or to boost low/mid/high frequency regions.
